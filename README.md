# Bash-scripts

Helper scripts for development

## Setup

### Linux

Make executable and put somewhere that gets sourced by bashrc

### Windows (Git Bash)

Create a .bashrc file in $HOME for loading config/aliases and alias a shortcut to the full path of the script

## Template.sh

Takes a single argument, creates a folder with that argument and creates webpage template within (index.html, style.css & script.js). Then either opens folder in VSCode or opens index.html in neovim for termux version.

## PySetup (TBC)

Create folder, create virtual environment, create main.py, open in editor and activate env
